# Exploring intrinsic triangulations for optimizing triangle mesh parameterizations

This is the code that is used for the bachelor thesis "Exploring intrinsic triangulations for optimizing triangle mesh parameterizations" supervised by Prof. Dr. Marc Alexa and Prof. Dr. Olga Sorkine-Hornung. 

Some parts are taken from my submission to the assigment 4 for the course Shape Modeling and Geometry Processing in 2022 Autumn Semester at ETH ZÃ¼rich and from the code that is used for iARAP (ARAP Revisited: Discretizing the Elastic Energy using Intrinsic Voronoi Cells).

The implementation is in the folder iparam.

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Instyx/intrinsic_parameterization.git
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make -j6
```
